# Yuna-Discord-Bot
A discord bot I made!
If you want use the code, feel free to! just put your token in the config file and put a channel ID in the Debug channel ID section!

Add it to your server: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=925504594329620551&permissions=8&scope=bot

Note that this runs on some old version of Discord.py. becuase I'm way too lazy to actually change things so it works with the new version. 
So if you want to run it yourself you have to have Discord.py 1.7.3 lol. Sorry, not sorry.
